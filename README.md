# Sarcasm Detection and Link Validity Checker

This repository contains Python code for two primary tasks:

1. Sarcasm Detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
2. Checking the validity of a provided URL/link.

## Sarcasm Detection

### Overview

Sarcasm detection is a fascinating application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This code performs sarcasm detection on textual data, specifically headlines, to determine whether a given text is sarcastic or not.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.7+)
- Libraries: pandas, requests, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, re, nltk, joblib, scikit-learn, tensorflow

### Usage

To utilize the sarcasm detection module:

1. Begin by importing the required libraries at the beginning of your Python script.
2. Load the Sarcasm Headlines dataset using `pandas.read_json()`. This dataset contains headlines and labels indicating whether each headline is sarcastic or not.
3. Clean the dataset by removing duplicates and preprocessing the text data.
4. Perform Sarcasm Detection using two methods: Naive Bayes and LSTM.
5. Save the trained Naive Bayes model for future use.
6. Save the trained LSTM model for future use.
7. Use the saved models to classify new text as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Importing Libraries**: To get started, import the necessary Python libraries. These include pandas for data manipulation, requests for making HTTP requests, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization, re for regular expressions, nltk for text processing, joblib for model persistence, scikit-learn for machine learning, and TensorFlow for deep learning.

2. **Loading the Dataset**: Use the `pandas.read_json()` function to load the Sarcasm Headlines dataset. This dataset contains a collection of headlines and labels (0 for non-sarcastic, 1 for sarcastic).

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by removing duplicate rows, pre-processing the text data, and removing unnecessary characters and stopwords. This ensures that the data is ready for analysis and model training.

4. **Sarcasm Detection Methods**: This code demonstrates two methods for sarcasm detection:

   - **Naive Bayes**: Implement Naive Bayes classification using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. Train the model and evaluate its accuracy on test data. You can save the trained model for future use.

   - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Implement deep learning for sarcasm detection using LSTM neural networks. Tokenize the text data, pad sequences to ensure equal length, and build an LSTM model. Train the model and evaluate its accuracy. Save the LSTM model for future use.

5. **Model Usage**: Once the models are trained, you can use them to classify new text as sarcastic or non-sarcastic. Simply provide a text input, and the models will make predictions.

## Link Validity Checker

### Overview

The second part of this code is a link validity checker. It verifies the validity of a given URL, providing a quick way to check if a link is functional.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.7+)
- Libraries: requests

### Usage

To utilize the link validity checker:

1. Import the `requests` library at the beginning of your Python script.
2. Define a function `is_valid_link(link)` to check the validity of a URL.
3. Prompt the user to enter a link they want to check.
4. Use the `is_valid_link()` function to determine if the provided link is valid.

## Example

To check if a link is valid, simply run the provided Python script and input the link when prompted.

To perform sarcasm detection, execute the code and follow the provided steps. You can use the saved models to classify new text as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.
